# qsm_hub (work in progress)  

## Introduction  

Welcome to the beta version of **qsm_hub**! **qsm_hub** is a tool providing a graphical user interface to build data processing pipeline of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in Matlab.

This GUI is built based on three toolboxes including [MEDI](http://weill.cornell.edu/mri/pages/qsm.html), [STI Suite](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~chunlei.liu/software.html) and [FANSI](https://gitlab.com/cmilovic/FANSI-toolbox).

**qsm_hub** provides two key features for QSM processing:  
1. mix-and-match methods from different toolboxes to build your own QSM processing pipeline,
2. graphical user interface to easily adjust parameters of different algorithms.

The objective of **qsm_hub** is to provide a platform for easy access of different QSM processing methods in the field. To achieve this, most of the codes were written for data flow and algorithm parameter control. Through **qsm_hub**, I hope researchers who are not expert in QSM would also be able to use QSM for their research. The instruction of this toolbox can be found in the [wiki page](https://github.com/kschan0214/qsm_hub/wiki)

This toolbox is still under development, so you may encounter some bugs.

## Terms of use
All the codes and methods developed by me in **qsm_hub** is under MIT license. You can check [the license file]() for more information. For the terms of use of the toolboxes related to this work, their own license applied and please check the corresponding license files of each toolbox for more information. 

When you use **qsm_hub** in your research, please cite the related papers of the methods in your processing pipeline. 

If you have any question or you would like to provide suggestion to improve this toolbox/report bug(s) please feel free to contact me k.chan@donders.ru.nl (Kwok-Shing Chan) directly or raise an issue in the [github page](https://github.com/kschan0214/qsm_hub/issues).
