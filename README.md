# SEPIA (SuscEptibility mapping PIpeline tool for phAse images)

![sepia logo](https://sepia-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/logo.png)

## Introduction  

**SEPIA** is a tool providing a graphical user interface to build data processing pipeline of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in Matlab.

This GUI is built to access the following toolboxes:
[MEDI](http://weill.cornell.edu/mri/pages/qsm.html), 
[STI Suite](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~chunlei.liu/software.html),
[FANSI](https://gitlab.com/cmilovic/FANSI-toolbox),  
[SEGUE](https://xip.uclb.com/i/software/SEGUE.html, and 
[nonlinear dipole inversion (NDI)](https://github.com/polakd/NDI_Toolbox).

SEPIA provides two key features for QSM processing:  
1. mix-and-match methods from different toolboxes to build your own QSM processing pipeline,
2. graphical user interface to easily adjust parameters of different algorithms.

SEPIA is designed to provide a platform for easy access to different QSM processing methods in the field. To achieve this, most of the codes were written for data flow and algorithm parameter control. Through SEPIA, I hope researchers who are not expert in QSM will also be able to use QSM for their research.

**For better readability, the documentation of SEPIA has moved to https://sepia-documentation.readthedocs.io/.**
