# Set-up xQSM in SEPIA

1. Download [deepMRI](https://github.com/sunhongfu/deepMRI) from GitHub
2. Download the pre-trained xQSM netwotks using this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/weps2m849svsh93/AAAAPqqKcLkL10Arqhy-3h_Fa?dl=0) (see https://github.com/sunhongfu/deepMRI/tree/master/xQSM)
3. Specify the full path to deepMRI code as 'deepMRI_HOME' in setup_xQSM_environment.m 
4. Specify the full path to the folder containing the pre-trained networks (should be checkpoints/) from (2) as 'checkpoint_dir' in setup_xQSM_environment.m
